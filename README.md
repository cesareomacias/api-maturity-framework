## Motivation

The API Maturity Framework is intended to be a continuous improvement tool for adidas APIs, providing consistent criteria to define an improvement path for API architects and engineers.

This framework provides a clear roadmap for API development and lifecycle management. By sharing this comprehensive guide, we empower teams to enhance their API best practices, ensuring consistency, quality, and innovation.

Fully aligned with[ Adidas API Guidelines](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines), this framework focuses primarily on API evolution across different levels. It also offers a method to establish the current level in each phase but always fostering the improvement and evolution.&#x20;

## Framework

The framework is structured according to the Adidas API Lifecycle.

Each phase encompasses distinct levels:

* Crawl
* Walk
* Run
* Fly

It’s important to note that **reaching each level requires fulfilling all the requirements of the previous** levels.
